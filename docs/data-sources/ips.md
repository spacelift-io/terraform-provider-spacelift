# spacelift_ips (Data Source)

`spacelift_ips` returns the list of Spacelift's outgoing IP addresses, which you can use to whitelist connections coming from the Spacelift's "mothership". **NOTE:** this does not include the IP addresses of the workers in Spacelift's public worker pool. If you need to ensure that requests made during runs originate from a known set of IP addresses, please consider setting up a [private worker pool](https://docs.spacelift.io/concepts/worker-pools).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "spacelift_ips" "ips" {}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "allow_spacelift" {
  type              = "ingress"
  from_port         = 443
  to_port           = 443
  protocol          = "tcp"
  cidr_blocks       = data.spacelift_ips.ips.cidrs
  security_group_id = aws_security_group.example.id
  description       = "Allow Spacelift IPs"
}
```
