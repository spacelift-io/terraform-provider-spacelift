## Schema

### Required

- **context_id** (String) ID of the attached context

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **module_id** (String) ID of the attached module
- **stack_id** (String) ID of the attached stack

### Read-Only

- **priority** (Number) Priority of the context attachment. All the contexts attached to a stack are sorted by priority (lowest first), though values don't need to be unique. This ordering establishes precedence rules between contexts should there be a conflict and multiple contexts define the same value.
