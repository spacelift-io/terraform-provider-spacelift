  spacelift_aws_role represents cross-account IAM role delegation https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html between the Spacelift worker and an individual stack or module. If this is set, Spacelift will use AWS STS to assume the supplied IAM role and put its temporary credentials in the runtime environment.
  If you use private workers, you can also assume IAM role on the worker side using your own AWS credentials (e.g. from EC2 instance profile).

# spacelift_stack_aws_role (Data Source)

`spacelift_aws_role` represents [cross-account IAM role delegation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) between the Spacelift worker and an individual stack or module. If this is set, Spacelift will use AWS STS to assume the supplied IAM role and put its temporary credentials in the runtime environment.

If you use private workers, you can also assume IAM role on the worker side using your own AWS credentials (e.g. from EC2 instance profile).

Note: when assuming credentials for **shared worker**, Spacelift will use `$accountName@$stackID` or `$accountName@$moduleID` as [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and Run ID as [session ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole).

## Example Usage

### For a Module

```hcl
data "spacelift_aws_role" "k8s-module" {
  module_id = "k8s-module"
}
```

### For a Stack

```hcl
data "spacelift_aws_role" "k8s-core" {
  stack_id = "k8s-core"
}
```
