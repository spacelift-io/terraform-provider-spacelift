# spacelift_space_by_path (Data Source)

`spacelift_space_by_path` represents a Spacelift **space** - a collection of resources such as stacks, modules, policies, etc. Allows for more granular access control. Can have a parent space. In contrary to `spacelift_space`, this resource is identified by a path, not by an ID. For this data source to work, path must be unique. If there are multiple spaces with the same path, this datasource will fail. 
**Disclaimer:** 
This datasource can only be used in a stack that resides in a space with inheritance enabled. In addition, the parent spaces (excluding root) must also have inheritance enabled.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "spacelift_space_by_path" "space" {
  space_path = "root/second space/my space"
}

output "space_description" {
  value = data.spacelift_space_by_path.space.description
}
```
