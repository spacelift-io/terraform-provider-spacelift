# spacelift_role (Data Source)

`spacelift_role` represents a Spacelift **role** - a collection of permissions that can be assigned to IdP groups or API keys to control access to Spacelift resources and operations.

You can either filter roles by their unique identifier (`role_id`) or by their URL-friendly unique identifier (`slug`).

**Note:** you must have admin access to the `root` Space in order to retrieve roles.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Retrieve a system role by name
data "spacelift_role" "admin" {
  slug = "space-admin"
}

# Retrieve a custom (non-system) role by ID
data "spacelift_role" "custom" {
  role_id = spacelift_role.custom_role.id
}
```
