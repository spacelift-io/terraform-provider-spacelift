  spacelift_stack_gcp_service_account represents a Google Cloud Platform service account that's linked to a particular Stack or Module. These accounts are created by Spacelift on per-stack basis, and can be added as members to as many organizations and projects as needed. During a Run or a Task, temporary credentials for those service accounts are injected into the environment, which allows credential-less GCP Terraform provider setup.
