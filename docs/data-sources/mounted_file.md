  spacelift_mounted_file represents a file mounted in each Run's workspace that is part of a configuration of a context (spacelift_context), stack (spacelift_stack) or a module (spacelift_module). In principle, it's very similar to an environment variable (spacelift_environment_variable) except that the value is written to the filesystem rather than passed to the environment.

# spacelift_mounted_file (Data Source)

`spacelift_mounted_file` represents a file mounted in each Run's workspace that is part of a configuration of a context (`spacelift_context`), stack (`spacelift_stack`) or a module (`spacelift_module`). In principle, it's very similar to an environment variable (`spacelift_environment_variable`) except that the value is written to the filesystem rather than passed to the environment.

## Example Usage

### For a context

```hcl
data "spacelift_mounted_file" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id    = "prod-k8s-ie"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
}
```

### For a module

```hcl
data "spacelift_mounted_file" "module-kubeconfig" {
  module_id     = "k8s-module"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
}
```

### For a stack

```hcl
data "spacelift_mounted_file" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id      = "k8s-core"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
}
```
