# spacelift_aws_integration_attachment (Resource)

`spacelift_aws_integration_attachment` represents the attachment between a reusable AWS integration and a single stack or module.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# For a stack
resource "spacelift_aws_integration_attachment" "this" {
  integration_id = spacelift_aws_integration.this.id
  stack_id       = "my-stack-id"
  read           = true
  write          = true

  # The role needs to exist before we attach since we test role assumption during attachment.
  depends_on = [
    aws_iam_role.this
  ]
}

# For a module
resource "spacelift_aws_integration_attachment" "this" {
  integration_id = spacelift_aws_integration.this.id
  module_id      = "my-module-id"
  read           = true
  write          = true

  # The role needs to exist before we attach since we test role assumption during attachment.
  depends_on = [
