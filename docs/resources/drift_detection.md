# spacelift_drift_detection (Resource)

`spacelift_drift_detection` represents a Drift Detection configuration for a Stack. It will trigger a proposed run on the given schedule, which you can listen for using run state webhooks. If reconcile is true, then a tracked run will be triggered when drift is detected.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spacelift_stack" "core-infra-production" {
  name       = "Core Infrastructure (production)"
  branch     = "master"
  repository = "core-infra"
}

resource "spacelift_drift_detection" "core-infra-production-drift-detection" {
  reconcile = true
  stack_id  = spacelift_stack.core-infra-production.id
  schedule  = ["*/15 * * * *"] # Every 15 minutes
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `schedule` (List of String) List of cron schedule expressions based on which drift detection should be triggered.
- `stack_id` (String) ID of the stack for which to set up drift detection

### Optional

- `ignore_state` (Boolean) Controls whether drift detection should be performed on a stack in any final state instead of just 'Finished'.
- `reconcile` (Boolean) Whether a tracked run should be triggered when drift is detected.
- `timezone` (String) Timezone in which the schedule is expressed. Defaults to `UTC`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import spacelift_drift_detection.core-infra-production-drift-detection stack/$STACK_ID

terraform import spacelift_drift_detection.core-infra-production-drift-detection module/$MODULE_ID
```
