## Schema

### Required

- `context_id` (String) ID of the context to attach

### Optional

- `module_id` (String) ID of the module to attach the context to
- `priority` (Number) Priority of the context attachment. All the contexts attached to a stack are sorted by priority (lowest first), though values don't need to be unique. This ordering establishes precedence rules between contexts should there be a conflict and multiple contexts define the same value. Defaults to `0`.
- `stack_id` (String) ID of the stack to attach the context to

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```
