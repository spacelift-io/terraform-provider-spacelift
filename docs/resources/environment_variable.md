# spacelift_environment_variable (Resource)

`spacelift_environment_variable` defines an environment variable on the context (`spacelift_context`), stack (`spacelift_stack`) or a module (`spacelift_module`), thereby allowing to pass and share various secrets and configuration with Spacelift stacks.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# For a context
resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id = "prod-k8s-ie"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
  value      = "/project/spacelift/kubeconfig"
  write_only = false
}

# For a module
resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "module-kubeconfig" {
  module_id  = "k8s-module"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
  value      = "/project/spacelift/kubeconfig"
  write_only = false
}

# For a stack
resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id   = "k8s-core"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
  value      = "/project/spacelift/kubeconfig"
  write_only = false
}
