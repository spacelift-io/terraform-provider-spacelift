  spacelift_mounted_file represents a file mounted in each Run's workspace that is part of a configuration of a context (spacelift_context), stack (spacelift_stack) or a module (spacelift_module). In principle, it's very similar to an environment variable (spacelift_environment_variable) except that the value is written to the filesystem rather than passed to the environment.

# spacelift_mounted_file (Resource)

`spacelift_mounted_file` represents a file mounted in each Run's workspace that is part of a configuration of a context (`spacelift_context`), stack (`spacelift_stack`) or a module (`spacelift_module`). In principle, it's very similar to an environment variable (`spacelift_environment_variable`) except that the value is written to the filesystem rather than passed to the environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# For a context
resource "spacelift_mounted_file" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id    = "prod-k8s-ie"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
  content       = filebase64("${path.module}/kubeconfig.json")
}

# For a module
resource "spacelift_mounted_file" "module-kubeconfig" {
  module_id     = "k8s-module"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
  content       = filebase64("${path.module}/kubeconfig.json")
}

# For a stack
resource "spacelift_mounted_file" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id      = "k8s-core"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
  content       = filebase64("${path.module}/kubeconfig.json")
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `relative_path` (String) Relative path to the mounted file, without the /mnt/workspace/ prefix

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `content` (String, Sensitive) Content of the mounted file encoded using Base-64
- `content_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Content of the mounted file encoded using Base-64. The content is not stored in the state. Modify content_wo_version to trigger an update. This field requires Terraform/OpenTofu 1.11+.
- `content_wo_version` (String) Used together with content_wo to trigger an update to the content. Increment this value when an update to content_wo is required. This field requires Terraform/OpenTofu 1.11+.
- `context_id` (String) ID of the context on which the mounted file is defined
- `description` (String) Free-form description of the mounted file
- `module_id` (String) ID of the module on which the mounted file is defined
- `stack_id` (String) ID of the stack on which the mounted file is defined
- `write_only` (Boolean) Indicates whether the content can be read back outside a Run. Defaults to `true`.

### Read-Only

- `checksum` (String) SHA-256 checksum of the value
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import spacelift_mounted_file.ireland-kubeconfig context/$CONTEXT_ID/$MOUNTED_FILE_ID

terraform import spacelift_mounted_file.module-kubeconfig module/$MODULE_ID/$MOUNTED_FILE_ID

terraform import spacelift_mounted_file.core-kubeconfig stack/$STACK_ID/$MOUNTED_FILE_ID
```
