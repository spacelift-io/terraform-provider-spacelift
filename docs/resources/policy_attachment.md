  spacelift_policy_attachment represents a relationship between a policy (spacelift_policy) and a stack (spacelift_stack) or module (spacelift_module). Each policy can only be attached to a stack/module once. LOGIN policies are the exception because they apply globally and not to individual stacks/modules. An attempt to attach one will fail.

# spacelift_policy_attachment (Resource)

`spacelift_policy_attachment` represents a relationship between a policy (`spacelift_policy`) and a stack (`spacelift_stack`) or module (`spacelift_module`). Each policy can only be attached to a stack/module once. `LOGIN` policies are the exception because they apply globally and not to individual stacks/modules. An attempt to attach one will fail.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spacelift_policy" "no-weekend-deploys" {
  name = "Let's not deploy any changes over the weekend"
  body = file("policies/no-weekend-deploys.rego")
  type = "PLAN"
}

resource "spacelift_stack" "core-infra-production" {
  name       = "Core Infrastructure (production)"
  branch     = "master"
  repository = "core-infra"
}

resource "spacelift_policy_attachment" "no-weekend-deploys" {
  policy_id = spacelift_policy.no-weekend-deploys.id
  stack_id  = spacelift_stack.core-infra-production.id
}
```
