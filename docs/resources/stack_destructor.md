# spacelift_stack_destructor (Resource)

`spacelift_stack_destructor` is used to destroy the resources of a Stack before deleting it. `depends_on` should be used to make sure that all necessery resources (environment variables, roles, integrations, etc.) are still in place when the destruction run is executed. **Note:** Destroying this resource will delete the resources in the stack. If this resource needs to be deleted and the resources in the stacks are to be preserved, ensure that the `deactivated` attribute is set to `true`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spacelift_stack" "k8s-core" {
  // ...
}

resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "credentials" {
  // ...
}

resource "spacelift_stack_destructor" "k8s-core" {
  depends_on = [
    spacelift_environment_variable.credentials,
  ]

  stack_id = spacelift_stack.k8s-core.id
}
```
