# Spacelift Terraform provider

The Spacelift Terraform provider is used to programmatically interact with its GraphQL API, allowing Spacelift to declaratively manage itself ðŸ¤¯

The full list of supported resources is available [here](#resources).

## Example usage

```python
provider "spacelift" {}

resource "spacelift_stack" "core-infra-production" {
  name = "Core Infrastructure (production)"

  administrative    = true
  branch            = "master"
  description       = "Shared production infrastructure (networking, k8s)"
  readers_team      = "engineering"
  repository        = "core-infra"
  terraform_version = "0.12.6"
  writers_team      = "devops"
}
```

## Setup

This provider is designed to require no setup. All runs in an [administrative stack](#todo) receive a temporary JWT token in the `SPACELIFT_API_TOKEN` environment variable, which is all the provider needs to run. **We strongly recommend using this approach**:

```python
provider "spacelift" {}
```

The alternative approach when not running in Spacelift is to pass a human user's JWT token, either through the environment (`SPACELIFT_API_TOKEN` variable) or using the provider's `api_token` field. Note though that all Spacelift tokens have a short expiry, so that in practice you will need to generate a new token before each Terraform run. **We discourage this approach**:

```python
variable "spacelift_api_token" {}

provider "spacelift" {
  api_token = var.spacelift_api_token
}
```

## Resources

The Spacelift Terraform provider provides the following building blocks:

- `spacelift_context` - [data source](#spacelift_context-data-source) and [resource](#spacelift_context-resource);
- `spacelift_context_attachment` - [data source](#spacelift_context_attachment_data-source) and [resource](#spacelift_context_attachment_resource);
- `spacelift_environment_variable` - [data source](#spacelift_environment_variable-data-source) and [resource](#spacelift_environment_variable-resource);

### `spacelift_context` data source

`spacelift_context` represents a Spacelift **context** - a collection of configuration elements (either environment variables or mounted files) that can be administratively attached to multiple [**stacks**](#spacelift_stack-resource) using a [**context attachment**]($spacelift_context_attachment_resource) resource.

#### Example usage

```python
data "spacelift_context" "prod-k8s-ie" {
  context_id = "prod-k8s-ie"
}
```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `context_id` - (Required) The immutable identifier (slug) of the context;

#### Attributes reference

See the [context resource](#spacelift_context-resource) for details on the returned attributes - they are identical.

### `spacelift_environment_variable` data source

`spacelift_environment_variable` defines an environment variable on the [context](#spacelift_context-resource) or a [stack](#spacelift_context-stack), thereby allowing to pass and share various secrets and configuration details between Spacelift stacks.

#### Example usage

For a context:

```python
data "spacelift_environment_variable" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id = "prod-k8s-ie"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
}
```

For a stack:

```python
data "spacelift_environment_variable" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id = "k8s-core"
  name     = "KUBECONFIG"
}
```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required) - Name of the environment variable;
- `context_id` - (Optional) - ID of the context on which the environment variable is defined;
- `stack_id` - (Optional) - ID of the stack on which the environment variable is defined;

Note that `context_id` and `stack_id` are mutually exclusive, and exactly one of them _must_ be specified.

#### Attributes reference

See the [environment variable resource](#spacelift_environment_variable-resource) for details on the returned attributes - they are identical.

### `spacelift_environment_variable` resource

`spacelift_environment_variable` defines an environment variable on the [context](#spacelift_context-resource) or a [stack](#spacelift_context-stack), thereby allowing to pass and share various secrets and configuration details between Spacelift stacks.

#### Example usage

For a context:

```python
resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id = "prod-k8s-ie"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
  value      = "/project/spacelift/kubeconfig"
  write_only = false
}
```

For a stack:

```python
resource "spacelift_environment_variable" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id   = "k8s-core"
  name       = "KUBECONFIG"
  value      = "/project/spacelift/kubeconfig"
  write_only = false
}
```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required) - Name of the environment variable;
- `value` - (Required) - Value of the environment variable;
- `write_only` - (Optional) - Indicates whether the value can be read back outside a Run - for safety, this defaults to **true**;
- `context_id` - (Optional) - ID of the context on which the environment variable is defined;
- `stack_id` - (Optional) - ID of the stack on which the environment variable is defined;

Note that `context_id` and `stack_id` are mutually exclusive, and exactly one of them _must_ be specified.

Also note that if `write_only` is set to `true`, the `value` is not stored in the state, and will not be reported back by either the data source or the resource. Instead, its SHA-256 checksum will be used to compare the new value to the one passed to Spacelift.

#### Attributes reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - ID of the environment variable;
- `checksum` - SHA-256 checksum of the value;

### `spacelift_mounted_file` data source

`spacelift_mounted_file` represents a file mounted in each Run's workspace that is part of a configuration of a [context](#spacelift_context-resource) or a [stack](#spacelift_context-stack). In principle, it's very similar to an [environment variable](#spacelift_environment_variable-resource) except that the value is written to the filesystem rather than passed to the environment.

#### Example usage

For a context:

```python
data "spacelift_mounted_file" "ireland-kubeconfig" {
  context_id    = "prod-k8s-ie"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
}
```

For a stack:

```python
data "spacelift_mounted_file" "core-kubeconfig" {
  stack_id      = "k8s-core"
  relative_path = "kubeconfig"
}
```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `relative_path` - (Required) - Relative path to the mounted file. The full (absolute) path to the file will be prefixed with `/spacelift/project/`;
- `context_id` - (Optional) - ID of the context on which the environment variable is defined;
- `stack_id` - (Optional) - ID of the stack on which the environment variable is defined;

Note that `context_id` and `stack_id` are mutually exclusive, and exactly one of them _must_ be specified.

#### Attributes reference

See the [mounted file resource](#spacelift_mounted_file-resource) for details on the returned attributes - they are identical.

}
```

For a stack:

```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

### `spacelift_stack` data source

`spacelift_stack` combines source code and configuration to create a runtime environment where resources are managed. In this way it's similar to a stack in AWS CloudFormation, or a project on generic CI/CD platforms.

#### Example usage

```python
data "spacelift_stack" "k8s-core" {
  stack_id = "k8s-core"
}
```

#### Argument reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `stack_id` - (Required) - The ID (slug) of the stack;

If this is set, Spacelift will use AWS STS to assume the supplied IAM role and put its temporary credentials in the runtime environment.

Note: when assuming credentials, Spacelift will use `$accountName/$stackID` as [external ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html) and Run ID as [session ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole).
